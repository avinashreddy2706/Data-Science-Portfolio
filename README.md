# Capstone-Project
Data Science Projects that showcase my skills in exploring, visualizing, analyzing, experimenting and modeling with data. 

1. Predicting Song likeability from Spotify audio data (Supervised Learning)

    Project Overview:
    
      Built a predictive model to classify whether a person likes a song or not based on its audio features.

    Skills : EDA, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Supervised Machine Learning, Classification

2. Classifying Income (Supervised Learning)

    Project Overview:  
    
      This project is about Classifying Income from 1994 Census Data. The goal is to predict if a person in USA earns over or under $50,000 for the year and find out which features are the best determinant for a person's income 

    Skills : EDA, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Supervised Machine Learning, Classification


3. Exchange Rate Analysis and Forecasting (Time Series Analysis and forecasting)

    Project Overview:  
    
      This project is about analysing exchange rate. The goal of this project is to develop a model which will predict currency exchange  rate for future. This will help investors and business owners to maximize their profit, manage the cash flow and take business expansion  decisions and investment opportunities.

    Skills : EDA, Data Cleaning,Time Series Analysis and Forecasting (ARIMA, AUTO ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM)

4. Unemployment Rate Analysis and Forecasting (Time Series Analysis and forecasting)

    Project Overview:  
    
      This project is about analysing unemployment rate for USA. The goal of this project is to analyse how the unemployment rate is going to change in future. The unemployment rate is one of the most important macroeconomic factors. The ability to predict it accurately could help policy makers take sound decisions about which policies to implement regarding the future state of the economy.
